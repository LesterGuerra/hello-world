Hello World!

I'm Lester, on my first semester in college I satrted an obligatory course of programming in C++, for a few weeks I didn't really like it, but after many hours in front of the screen, I ended up falling in love with it. And now, nine months after, I'm an autodidact in other 5 programming languages and I'm ready to show what I can do here in GitHub.
